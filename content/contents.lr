intro:

Python has had awesome string formatting capabilities for a long time but the documentation on them is far too theoretic and technical.

With this site we try to show you the most common use-cases covered by the [% ("mod", "old-style")](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting), ["".format()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string-formatting) and [f'' ("f-Strings")](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings) style string formatting APIs with practical examples.
All examples on this page are annotated to show in which version of Python they work. The big majority are supported in all "current" versions of Python - at the moment that is Python 2.7 and 3.3 - 3.6.

If you want to contribute more examples, feel free to open an issue or create a pull-request on [GitHub](https://github.com/ulope/pyformat.info)!
